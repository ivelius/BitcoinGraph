# BitcoinGraph
This is a small solution for a given task that is hopefully showecases some of my skills.

### Read Me First
This is by no means my best work. I've decided to not invest too much time in this "coding challenge" due to other duties I have as a full stack Android team lead and a Husband :)
I don't want to be disrespectful to your requirements , but I ask for your understanding on this matter.
I hope you will find what you are looking for in this code , and we will have enough "meat" for discussion during face 2 face interview.
This repository does not contain any mentions of the company and will be deleted ASAP . In that way I will make sure , no other potential candidates will use this repository for cheating.


### What I did and what I did not

  - It is a standard project you can import directly into your Android studio (if you are using Eclipse , please close this page and never call me ...)
  - I've used popular frameworks in this project , I am following trends :)
  - For DI I used Dagger2 even though I am not happy with it . I can explain you why F2F .
  - Unit tests are not covering everything , maybe not even half of what I could do. I only did enough unit tests to show you how I work with them.
  - As I intended to keep this project small  , you might not find much of inheritance there or any design patterns . I am aware of that .
  - MVP realisation is not set in stone and there are many variants of it . What I have used is not neccessary the "best" one. But just to show you that I know what it is and how it is done.
  - For tests I usually use vanilla Junit to test my buisness logic (it is fast) including presenters (Here Dagger 2 really sucks). UItests I usually test with Espresso. I do not use Roboelectric for various reasons .
  - My custom view that renders the Graph is dead simple , though I could make it super fancy and implement pinch to zoom and other cool stuf (If you want to see an example of custom view I did , please see the WatchView repository in my Github account)
  - In general if you want to have an impression of my coding skills , there are plenty of repos in my Github account you can explore .
  - You also won't find in this project any Fragments or activity transitions , animations etc ... If that is what you looking for , please see my other projects.

Well basically all mentioned above is an attempt to convince you that I am much more than you see in this project :)
But it is always up to you to decide...

Hope to see you soon ;)
